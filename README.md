# Welcome to My GitHub!

## About Me
üëã Hi, I'm Yashvardhan! I'm a passionate software developer with experience in building dynamic full-stack web applications and real-time data systems. My core stack includes React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, and I have a deep interest in Kafka, Python, and PostgreSQL for data engineering. I love solving complex problems and thrive in collaborative environments where I can learn from others and contribute to impactful projects. üíª

During my journey as a software engineer at Cisco, I developed a Kafka consumer to streamline the retrieval of over 1 million data records, optimizing processes and saving both time and resources. Additionally, I created a React-based frontend dashboard for real-time analytics, solidifying my passion for building scalable, efficient solutions. üöÄ

I'm always excited to explore new technologies and continuously improve my skill set. When I'm not coding, you might find me diving into research projects or playing basketball üèÄ. Feel free to check out my repositories and let‚Äôs connect! ‚ú®
